# tableau-dashboard-customer-segmentation-uk-bank
This Tableau dashboard explores customer segmentation using a synthetic UK banking dataset. It highlights demographic and financial patterns across customer groups and provides interactive views to support data-driven insights into customer behavior.


📈 The dataset used in this project is UK-Bank-Customers.csv, a synthetic dataset representing customer information from a UK-based bank. It contains demographic and financial attributes for 4,014 customers, created for educational and analytical purposes.

📊 Result demostration
To make the project accessible to a general audience, two dashboard screenshots are included:
Screenshot-1-baseline-All-countries.jpg presents an overview of the full dataset across all regions.
Screenshot-2-Scotland-only.jpg focuses on customers from Scotland, demonstrating how regional filtering changes the observed patterns.
These screenshots enable viewers to understand the dashboard structure, interactivity, and insights without requiring Tableau to be installed, while the full Tableau workbook provides a richer interactive experience.
